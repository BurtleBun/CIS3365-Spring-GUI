# CIS3365-Spring-GUI
This is a GUI created for the CIS3365 Spring course's final project.

For this project, we worked with LV Nail Salon to digitally transform their manual record-keeping system with a sophisticated SQL database hosted on an AWS server.The frontend and backend components were developed using a stack that included Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and EJS.

*Unfortunately, the AWS server was shut down, and so not all rendered pages can be shown here, but the code and scripts still reside in the repository.*
